# Probability library 
The probability library is designed to store probabilities for assemblies under certain considerations
for different type of neutron histories. The considerations will be:
  1. Wether it considers void or not in the serpent model of the coarse node
  2. Symmetry assumption to calculate the collision probabilities
  3. resonance table sampling activated or not
